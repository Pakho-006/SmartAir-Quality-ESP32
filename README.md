# SmartAir-Quality-ESP32
This Arduino script is designed for an ESP32 microcontroller and involves several advanced features, including web connectivity, touchscreen interface management, and data handling. It appears to be part of a project related to monitoring and displaying environmental data, possibly for an "Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)" monitoring system.

Key Components and Their Functions:
Web Server and WiFi Management:

The script uses the ESPAsyncWebServer and ESPAsyncWiFiManager libraries for managing WiFi connections and setting up a local web server. This suggests that the device can connect to WiFi networks and possibly host web pages for configuration or data display.
Touchscreen Interface:

Utilizes the FT6236 library, indicating the presence of a capacitive touchscreen interface. The script includes code to detect touches and respond to user interactions.
Display Management:

Employs the TFT_eSPI library for controlling a TFT display. The script includes various functions to display text and graphics, such as environmental readings like temperature, humidity, NH3, H2S, and PM2.5 levels.
Time-Dependent Operations:

The script uses millis() for timing, executing certain functions at regular intervals. This includes checking for firmware updates and performing routine tasks.
Data Retrieval and Parsing:

It fetches data from specified URLs (HTTPClient) and parses JSON responses. This data likely represents environmental measurements, which are then displayed on the TFT screen.
System Reset and Watchdog Timer:

Implements a reset function (reset()) and uses the ESP's task watchdog timer for system stability.
Custom Fonts and Graphics:

Uses a custom font file for display enhancements, suggesting a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
Firmware Version Management:

Manages firmware version information, hinting at the capability for remote updates or version checks.
General Functionality:
The system seems to function as a smart environmental monitoring device, likely intended for indoor spaces (e.g., monitoring air quality in a toilet). It displays real-time data on a TFT screen and allows user interaction through a touchscreen interface.
It can connect to WiFi networks, possibly for data retrieval or system updates.
The device operates with a focus on user experience, indicated by the use of a touchscreen and custom display features.
